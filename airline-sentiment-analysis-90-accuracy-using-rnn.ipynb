Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network that are particularly well-suited to modeling sequences of data, such as natural language text. In this task, we can use RNNs to classify tweets about airlines into positive, negative or neutral categories.\n\nHere is a high-level overview of the steps involved in building an airline sentiment analysis model using RNNs:\n\n1. Data Preprocessing: The first step is to prepare the data for training the RNN. This involves cleaning the text data by removing stop words, special characters, and URLs. We also tokenize the text data and convert it into numerical format.\n\n2. Feature Extraction: Next, we convert the tokenized text data into a fixed-length vector using techniques such as Word2Vec or GloVe.\n\n3. Model Building: We can build a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to classify the sentiment of the airline tweets. We can use architectures such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to model the sequence of the text data.\n\n4. Model Training: We can train the RNN model on the preprocessed and feature-extracted data. We can use techniques such as cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance.\n\n5. Model Testing: We can test the trained model on new, unseen data to evaluate its performance.\n\n**Here are the steps in more detail:**\n\n**Data Preprocessing:**\nWe start by importing the necessary libraries for data cleaning and tokenization, such as NLTK and spaCy. We then load the airline tweets dataset and perform some initial data exploration. We can also remove any irrelevant or noisy data such as tweets that contain links or mentions of other Twitter users. After that, we perform text cleaning by removing stop words, special characters, and other noise from the text data. Finally, we tokenize the text data and convert it into numerical format for feature extraction.\n\n**Feature Extraction:**\nWe can extract features from the tokenized text data using techniques such as Word2Vec or GloVe. These methods convert the text data into fixed-length vectors that can be fed into the RNN model. We can also use techniques such as tf-idf or bag-of-words to represent the text data.\n\n**Model Building:**\nWe can build a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to classify the sentiment of the airline tweets. We can use architectures such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to model the sequence of the text data. We can also use techniques such as dropout and batch normalization to regularize the model and prevent overfitting.\n\n**Model Training:**\nWe can train the RNN model on the preprocessed and feature-extracted data. We can use techniques such as cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance. We can also use techniques such as early stopping to prevent the model from overfitting the training data.\n\n**Model Testing:**\nWe can test the trained model on new, unseen data to evaluate its performance. We can use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the model's performance on the test data. We can also use techniques such as confusion matrix and ROC curve to analyze the model's performance in more detail.\n\nIn summary, building an airline sentiment analysis model using RNNs involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model building, model training, and model testing. With the right techniques and tools, we can build a robust and accurate model that can classify the sentiment of airline tweets with high accuracy.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Import the Neccesary Libraries**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import re\nimport warnings\nimport itertools\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nimport seaborn as sns\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer\nfrom keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=FutureWarning)","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-03-01T15:53:16.821009Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-03-01T15:53:16.821313Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-03-01T15:53:19.698105Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-03-01T15:53:16.821260Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-03-01T15:53:19.697176Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/dtypes.py:516: FutureWarning: Passing (type, 1) or '1type' as a synonym of type is deprecated;
